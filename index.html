            <p>I enjoy video games, anime, music and hiking. I don't enjoy loud noise, large crowds and pork sausages.
                I am 26 years old and plan on pursuing programming as a career.

            <p>South Africa is a beautiful country with a vibrant landscape. It is unfortunatelt currently a failed country. 
                Although the picture looks quite serene, there is rampant crime and corruption on every level of society.
                The current governement cannot and will not maintain the country, as a result people are immigrating to 1st world countries.
                Despite this however, South Africans are among the friendliest and kindest people in the world and do their best to be positive.</p>
